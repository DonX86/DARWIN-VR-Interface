DARwIn-OP Virtual Reaity Interface

The goal of this project is create VR(Virtual Reality) based environment for interacting with the robotics research platform DARwIn-OP.
The Unity 5 game engine and the Oculus DK2 are used to create a visual interface where the user can view Darwin's buitl in webcam. The Oculus is used to obtain the position data of the users head and relay it back to darwin using Unity 5. This means Darwin will mimick the users head motions.
